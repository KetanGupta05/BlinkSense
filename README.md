#BlinkSense: A Blink Monitoring and Reminder Web App


##Overview

BlinkSense is a web-based application designed to help users maintain healthy blinking patterns while working on screens. By leveraging computer vision and real-time data processing, BlinkSense tracks the user's blink rate through a webcam and provides notifications when the blink count is below a healthy threshold, reducing the risk of digital eye strain.


##Features

->Real-Time Blink Detection: Uses facial landmark detection via FaceMesh to track blinking patterns.

->Blink Count Monitoring: Displays the user's blink count on the web app in real time.

->Desktop Notifications: Sends reminders when the blink rate is below a safe level.

->Web-Based Interface: Accessible through any browser, featuring an intuitive and user-friendly design.

->Customizable Alerts: Allows users to configure thresholds and notification settings.



##Technology Stack

->Frontend

   ->HTML5/CSS3: For structuring and styling the web interface.
   
   ->JavaScript: Implements dynamic features such as webcam feed integration and blink count display.
   
->Backend

   ->Python (Flask): Handles real-time data processing and API endpoints.
   
->Computer Vision

   ->OpenCV: For processing video feed from the webcam.
   
   ->MediaPipe FaceMesh: Detects facial landmarks to calculate blink rates.
   
->Notification System

   ->Plyer: Sends desktop notifications.
